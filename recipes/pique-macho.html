    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Pique A Lo Macho is a Bolivian culinary masterpiece
            in my opinion! I had tried this dish several times
            even before visiting Bolivia. My wife's roots are in Tarija,
            Bolivia. When we were dating, Pique Macho was one of the first
            dishes she had made for me. Then I had the chance to have
            this dish in Bolivia too. If you are a meat lover and comfort
            food lover, this dish is for you!

            <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>3 tbsps olive oil</li>
            <li>4 Russet potatoes</li>
            <li>1.5 cups avocado oil for frying potatoes traditionally
                you'd use vegetable oil for this or peanut oil</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Start by marinating beef chunks with mustard, salt,
                pepper, cumin and soy sauce. Mix very well, cover 
                the bowl and refrigerate while you prep and cook 
                everything else.
            </li>

            <li>
                Cut sausages in a slanted angle. Set aside. Peel 
                potatoes and place in a bowl of water. Slice peppers,
                jalopeño, tomatoes and onions. Place onions in another
                bowl of water. Cut the potatoes in desired shape 
                (not too thin since they'll be in the bottom of the 
                platter) and let them dry on a colander.
            </li>

            <li>
                Boil eggs for about 10 minutes, remove from heat.
                Peel once cool to touch, slice eggs in half. 
                Set aside as well.
            </li>

            <li>
                Get a large skillet, add avocado oil 
                (or any vegetable oil of your choice). Wait until oil is
                hot then add potatoes, fry on both sides and remove 
                 with a slotted ladle. Alternatively, if you don't want
                to fry potatoes you can use frozen french fries and 
                bake them.
            </li>

            <li>
                Once you've removed fries from skillet, add beef franks
                to same skillet. Cook for few minutes and remove with
                slotted ladle as well, set aside.
            </li>

            <li>
                Get another skillet, add 3 tbsps of olive oil. 
                Add marinated meat once oil is hot. Cook until brown on
                all sides, use a wooden spoon and mix so meat doesn't 
                stick to skillet. Then add beer and let cook until
                alcohol evaporates. This process helps tenderize 
                the meat. Finally a minute or so later add 1 cup of 
                water, let meat cook another 10 or so minutes. 
                Add the sausage back in and mix everything together 
                so flavors can mix. Set aside and turn heat off.
            </li>

            <li>
                Once everything is ready, it's time to mount the dish.
                This is my favorite part :). You can customize this step
                as desired!! Start by putting the potatoes first. 
                Then add the meat and sausages with some of the broth
                they cooked in. Layer peppers, tomatoes, jalapeños, 
                onions and eggs as desired. Add chili peppers too 
                for more heat.
            </li>

            <li>    
                Finally squeeze some mayo and ketchup on top of the 
                platter, add a side of llajua and dig in:)). 
                You won't be able to stop!! Enjoy / Buen Provecho!!
