            Every person in my family would rank Tres Leches Cake 
            in our top favorites of all time! I love that it’s not 
            overly sweet, it’s super easy to make, I can make it 
            in advance, and its absolutely delicious! We make it 
            really often, especially when we’re having a bunch of 
            other Mexican food favorites to serve with it.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
            </li>

            <li>
                In a medium bowl combine flour, baking powder, and 
                salt. Separate the eggs into two other mixing bowls.
            </li>

            <li>
                Add ¾ cup sugar to the bowl with the egg yolks and
                mix on high speed until yolks are pale yellow. 
                Add ⅓ cup milk and vanilla and stir to combine.
                Pour the egg yolk mixture over the flour mixture
                and stir gently just until combined 
                (don't over-mix).
            </li>

            <li>
                Use electric beaters to beat the egg whites on high
                speed. As the begin to whip into stiff peaks, 
                gradually mix in the remaining ¼ cup of sugar. 
                Fold the stiffly beaten egg whites into the batter
                gently, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl,
                until combined.
            </li>

            <li>
                Pour batter into un-greased pan and smooth it into
                an even layer. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, 
                or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the
                cake comes out clean. Remove from the oven and 
                allow cake to cool completely.
            </li>

            <li>
                Combine the evaporated milk, sweetened condensed 
                milk, and whole milk in a small bowl. Once the cake
                has cooled use a fork to poke holes all over the 
                top of the cake.
            </li>

            <li>
                Slowly pour the milk mixture over the the top of 
                the cake, making sure to pour near the edges and 
                all around. Refrigerate the cake for at least 
                1 hour or overnight, to allow it to soak up the 
                milk.
            </li>

            <li>
                In the meantime, whip the heavy cream, sugar and 
                vanilla until stiff peaks. Smooth over the top of 
                the cake. Sprinkle cinnamon on top. Serve with
                fresh sliced strawberries, if desired. Enjoy!
